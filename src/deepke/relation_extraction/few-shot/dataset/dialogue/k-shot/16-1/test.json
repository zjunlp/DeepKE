And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she... is... beautiful... and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.",
