        prompts: The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays.
        temperature: What sampling temperature to use. Higher values means the model will take more risks. Try 0.9 for more creative applications, and 0 (argmax sampling) for ones with a well-defined answer.
                    We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.
        max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion.
                    The token count of your prompt plus max_tokens cannot exceed the model's context length. Most models have a context length of 2048 tokens (except for the newest models, which support 4096).
        top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.
                We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.
        frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.
        presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.
        stop: Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.
